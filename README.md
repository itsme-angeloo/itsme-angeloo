👋 I'm Geloo, an Implementation Engineer

Driven by curiosity, fueled by code.<br>
Computer Engineering graduate, currently working as an Implementation Engineer, diving deep into web development and software solutions. My goal is to become a highly skilled and impactful software engineer, building innovative solutions that make a real difference.<br><br>

👀 I love creating websites and applications that are both visually appealing and functional. I enjoy designing interfaces and turning them into interactive, user-friendly experiences.

🌱 I'm continuously learning to build complete web projects — from frontend interfaces to backend functionality — so I can deliver fully functional applications.

💖 I'm looking to collaborate with people passionate about web development, so we can learn from each other and work on meaningful projects together.

🎨 My focus is on usability and aesthetics — making software intuitive, enjoyable, and visually appealing.

When I’m not coding or implementing solutions, you’ll find me gaming online or enjoying a motorcycle ride.
